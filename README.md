👋 Hi, I’m @nhanhuynh296

I wanted to contribute to developing web app, mobile application. I enjoyed creating software from a prototype, documenting design and coding!
I also excited in solving problem, more specifically hacky way to problems. Not that I am lazy, I like auditing an application and trying to break inside and raise awareness to the developers. I really enjoy a collaborative, sharing knowledge and skill environment.

👀 I’m interested in machine learning and 

🌱 I’m currently learning software security
